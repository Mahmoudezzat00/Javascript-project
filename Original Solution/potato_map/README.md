The Student Requirements System of Eötvös Loránd University
(ELTE's Organizational and Operational Rules, Volume II, Section 74/C.) states that as long as a student presents another student's work - or at least a significant part of it - as their own, it counts as a disciplinary offense.
The most serious consequence of a disciplinary offense is the expulsion of the student from the university.
